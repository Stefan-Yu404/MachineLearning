This repository is a course based project. 

Description:  
For the reason that except for the Deep learning models repository, the file include no projects about ML, I use this repository as a review and record some toy projects done for the class.  

The codes are mainly written by python of the format .ipynb.

The contents are based the course STAT 415: Introdution to Machine Learning by Bradly C Stadie in Northwestern University. For the codes and other stuff are mainly supplement by myself as a review. If you are interested in ML, it may also a great material to refer to. Thanks to the professor, he's already covered most of the contents that we will meet.  

The repository stucture:
1. CourseWork: Course contents, knowledge outlines and contents.  
2. Projects -> Data  
            -> Codes
